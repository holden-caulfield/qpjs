Quien Pasa? - JS. A very silly library to tell who wins on two-legged knockout series

## Why doing this?

Short answer: just for fun.

Long answer: at [SCV](www.scvsoft.com) we love _f√∫tbol_. We were having arguments
on a [Copa Libertadores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Sudamericana) knockout
leg about who will pass to the next stage considering the slightly convoluted
system they have. One of us mentioned it would be nice to have an app for it.
So this library would be useful for that.

Another (and maybe slightly more important) reason was this was a good excuse to
do a super simple example on how to publish an npm module with all the niceties
for a good dev environment (ES6, tests, linter)
